			<h3>What qualifications should I have to begin my flight training?
			</h3>
			To begin training, you must be declared medically fit to participate by an approved aviation medical
			examiner. You don’t need any prerequisite subject experience, but you will benefit from an understanding of
			math and science concepts.<br>
			<h3>How old do I have to be to begin flying lessons and get license?</h3>
			You may begin training at 16 years of age. Licenses may be issued at the following ages:

			<li>17 years old for a PPL</li>
			<li>18 years old for a CPL</li>
			<li>21 years old for an ATPL</li>
			<br>
			<h3>How long does training take?
			</h3>
			The duration of your training is contingent upon your schedule and whether you join as a full-time or a
			part-time student. On average, it takes between 4 and 6 months to receive a PPL, and between 18 to 24 months
			to complete the full coursework required for a CPL with IFR. After completing training you will be able to
			have your airline transport pilot license.<br>
			<h3>Must I have good English language skills?
			</h3>
			Yes, English proficiency is a requirement by law, minimum is a Level 4.
			<br>
			<h3>
				Where will I work once I have my PPL/CPL?

			</h3>
			As a PPL you may not fly for remuneration, only for pleasure and at your own expense in order to obtain the
			legal requirements for a higher type license, i.e. CPL
			As a CPL, you may conduct flights for remuneration, provided it is done so under a legal operator’s
			certificate. Many of our CPL graduated pilots find themselves working for charter companies, or in
			neighboring countries. Quite a few of our CPL graduates have also moved into the airline industry, servicing
			both local and international carriers. A further advance to the CPL is to obtain an instructors rating, only
			for those candidates that have an absolute passion for not only aviation, but also for teaching it to others
			and helping to fulfill their dreams.<br>
			<h3>Does this aviation have places to visit other than training?
			</h3>
			Yes, This aviation provides places that are countrysides or mountains like Arizona rather than city in order
			to study and feel the nature for the visiting. If you want to know about places to visit, Contact;
			0193302828, 0193302829 for more information. Providing you are searching for latest places to visit, you can
