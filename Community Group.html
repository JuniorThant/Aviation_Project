	<p>Federally-leased airports (excluding Mt. Isa and Tennant Creek) have established Community Aviation Consultation Groups (CACGs), which provide an effective avenue for local community engagement on airport planning and operations, including aircraft noise. The Department for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications provides guidelines for CACGs.

Non federally-leased airports may also choose to establish CACGs or community forums.

CACG membership depends on the characteristics of the airport and any local issues of community concern however, generally includes:

<li>airport management</li>
<li>aircraft operators</li>
<li>community organisations or representatives</li>
<li>representatives from state, territory or local government bodies</li>
<li>local tourism and business groups.</li>
<p>Airservices does not formally belong to CACGs, but we are invited to attend to provide relevant information and assist in discussions.  We engage with CACGs on flight path and airspace changes, as well as technical reviews, such as noise monitoring and noise abatement procedures.</p></div>

				<h1>Aviation Laws</h1>
	<p>The powers bestowed upon the aircraft commander are listed in the Convention from Article 6 to Article 10. The aircraft commander has all the powers to deal with unruly passengers. In certain circumstances, the cabin crew has powers as well. If the aircraft commander has reasonable grounds to conclude that a passenger has committed or will commit a criminal offence while on-board which would jeopardise the safety of everyone and the aircraft, then he can take reasonable measures which are required:
<ol type="1">
<li>For the protection of the safety of the aircraft, the passengers, the crew members or the property therein;</li>
<li>For maintaining good order and discipline on board; or</li>
<li>For enabling himself to deliver such unruly passengers to competent authorities or to disembark them.</li>
</ol>
<p>There can be instances wherein an unruly passenger would opt for legal actions against the carrier for disembarking them from the flight or any other restraining actions taken against them. If the aircraft commander, cabin crew or the passengers have exercised their powers as per the Tokyo Convention, then they stand immune from prosecution or civil action with regard to the actions that they have taken. Such immunity also extends to the owner and operator of the aircraft.

It is significant to note that this statutory immunity does not extend to claims from other passengers who were disrupted or injured by the passenger. This immunity is restricted to suits filed by the unruly passenger themselves.
