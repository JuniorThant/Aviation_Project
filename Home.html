		<h1>Glider</h1>
		<p>A glider is a fixed-wing aircraft that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its lifting surfaces, and whose free flight does not depend on an engine.[1] Most gliders do not have an engine, although motor-gliders have small engines for extending their flight when necessary by sustaining the altitude (normally a sailplane relies on rising air to maintain altitude) with some being powerful enough to take off self-launch.

There are a wide variety of types differing in the construction of their wings, aerodynamic efficiency, location of the pilot, controls and intended purpose. Most exploit meteorological phenomena to maintain or gain height. Gliders are principally used for the air sports of gliding, hang gliding and paragliding. However some spacecraft have been designed to descend as gliders and in the past military gliders have been used in warfare. Some simple and familiar types of glider are toys such as paper planes and balsa wood gliders.</p></div>

			<h1>Para Glider</h1>
			<p>Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'speed bag' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>

			<h1>Hand Glider</h1>
			<p>Australian inventor John Wallace Dickenson has been credited with the invention of the modern hang glider and was a recipient of the FAI Gold Air Medal, the highest award given by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the world governing body for air sports, aeronautics and astronautics world records.

Hang gliding first occurred in the early 1960s with kites being towed by boats. The first foot-launched hang glider flight took place in 1972. Since then, the design and materials used in hang gliders have evolved significantly. Modern hang gliders may use materials such as tubing frame and sail cloth wings, or carbon fibre and epoxy for lightweight strength.

Hang gliders are controlled by the pilot shifting their body weight either back, forwards or to the side.</p>
